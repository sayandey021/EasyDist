# Privacy Policy for EasyDist

**Effective Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025

**Saayan Studio** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our desktop application, **EasyDist** (the "Application").

---

## 1. Overview

**EasyDist is a completely offline, local-first desktop application.** We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any of your personal data, project files, or usage information.

---

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we do NOT collect:

*   ❌ **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personally identifiable information.
*   ❌ **No Usage Analytics:** We do not track how you use the Application, which features you access, or how often you use it.
*   ❌ **No Telemetry:** We do not send any data about your system, crashes, or errors to our servers.
*   ❌ **No Project Data:** We do not access, read, or transmit your project files, source code, or configurations outside your local machine.
*   ❌ **No Network Requests:** The Application does not make any network requests to our servers during normal operation.

---

## 3. Local Data Storage

The Application stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

*   **Application Settings:** Your preferences (theme, sidebar state, window size) are stored locally using Electron's storage APIs.
*   **History:** Package generation history is stored locally for your convenience.
*   **Session Data:** Temporary session data (like sidebar scroll position) is stored in browser session storage.

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is stored in your user profile directory
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the Application

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Application may interact with third-party services **only when you explicitly initiate such actions**:

### 4.1 External Links
When you click on external links within the Application (e.g., to documentation, developer portals, or store submission pages), you will be directed to those third-party websites. These sites have their own privacy policies.

### 4.2 Package Repositories & App Stores
If you use generated package files to publish to third-party platforms (e.g., Flathub, F-Droid, Microsoft Store, AUR, Copr, etc.), those interactions are governed by the respective privacy policies of those platforms. The Application itself does not automatically submit or upload anything to these services.

### 4.3 Software Updates (Optional)
The Application may check for updates from GitHub Releases. This involves:
- Standard HTTPS requests to GitHub's servers
- GitHub may log basic access information (IP address) per their [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

You can disable update checks in the Application settings.

---

## 5. Data Security

Since EasyDist operates entirely offline and locally:

*   Your data's security depends on your own device and operating system security
*   We recommend keeping your operating system and the Application updated
*   Use standard security practices (strong passwords, disk encryption, etc.)

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

EasyDist is a software development tool and is not directed at children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data collection from any users, including children.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data:

*   There is no data to access, correct, or delete from our servers
*   All your data is stored locally and under your control
*   You can delete all Application data by uninstalling EasyDist

---

## 8. Open Source

EasyDist is developed with transparency in mind. You can review our source code to verify our privacy practices.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be:
- Posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date
- Noted in the Application's release notes

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
